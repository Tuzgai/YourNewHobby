Karaoke  ( ;  Japanese:  [kaɾaoke]   ( listen ) ;  カラオケ , clipped compound of Japanese  kara   空  "empty" and  ōkesutora   オーケストラ  "orchestra") is a type of interactive entertainment developed in Japan in which people sing along to recorded music using a microphone. The music is an instrumental version of a well-known popular song. Lyrics are usually displayed on a video screen, along with a moving symbol, changing colour, or music video images, to guide the singer. In Chinese-speaking countries and regions such as mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, a karaoke box is called a KTV. The global karaoke market has been estimated to be worth nearly $10 billion.
