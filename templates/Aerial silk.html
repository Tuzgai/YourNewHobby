Aerial silks  (also known as  aerial contortion ,  aerial ribbons ,   aerial tissues ,  fabric ,  ribbon , or  tissu , depending on personal preference) is a type of performance in which one or more artists perform aerial acrobatics while hanging from a fabric. The fabric may be hung as two pieces, or a single piece, folded to make a loop, classified as hammock silks. Performers climb the suspended fabric without the use of safety lines and rely only on their training and skill to ensure safety. They use the fabric to wrap, suspend, drop, swing, and spiral their bodies into and out of various positions. Aerial silks may be used to fly through the air, striking poses and figures while flying.  Some performers use dried or spray rosin on their hands and feet to increase the friction and grip on the fabric.
