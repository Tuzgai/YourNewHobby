Vehicle restoration  is the process of restoring a vehicle back to its original working condition. Whether the car is partially scrapped or completely totaled.  Automotive restoration can be applied to many different eras of the automobile. Heritage railways and railway museums aim to restore and operate restored trains. Bus preservation groups aim to purchase buses of various eras to restore them to their original operating condition. Trains and buses are often restored to the original authentic livery of their original owner.
