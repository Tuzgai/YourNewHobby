Tai chi  (simplified Chinese:  太极 ; traditional Chinese:  太極 ; pinyin:  Tàijí ), short for  T'ai chi ch'üan  or  Tàijí quán  ( 太極拳 ), sometimes colloquially known as "Shadowboxing", is an internal Chinese martial art practiced for defense training, health benefits, and meditation. The term  taiji  is a Chinese cosmological concept for the flux of yin and yang, and 'quan' means fist. Etymologically, Taijiquan is a fist system based on the dynamic relationship between polarities (Yin and Yang). Developed as a martial art, it is practiced for other reasons: competitive wrestling in the format of pushing hands ( tui shou ), demonstration competitions, and greater longevity. As a result, a multitude of traditional and modern training forms exist corresponding to those aims with differing emphasis. Some training forms of tai chi are practiced with extremely slow movements.  Today, tai chi has enthusiastic practitioners worldwide. Most modern styles of tai chi trace their development to one or more of the five traditional schools: Chen, Yang, Wu (Hao), Wu, and Sun. All trace their historical origins to Chen Village.
