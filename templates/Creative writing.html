Creative writing  is any writing that goes outside the bounds of normal professional, journalistic, academic, or technical forms of literature, typically identified by an emphasis on narrative craft, character development, and the use of literary tropes or with various traditions of poetry and poetics. Due to the looseness of the definition, it is possible for writing such as feature stories to be considered creative writing, even though they fall under journalism, because the content of features is specifically focused on narrative and character development. Both fictional and non-fictional works fall into this category, including such forms as novels, biographies, short stories, and poems. In the academic setting, creative writing is typically separated into fiction and poetry classes, with a focus on writing in an original style, as opposed to imitating pre-existing genres such as crime or horror. Writing for the screen and stage—screenwriting and playwriting—are often taught separately, but fit under the creative writing category as well.  Creative writing can technically be considered any writing of original composition. In this sense, creative writing is a more contemporary and process-oriented name for what has been traditionally called literature, including the variety of its genres. In her work,  Foundations of Creativity , Mary Lee Marksberry references Paul Witty and Lou LaBrant's  Teaching the People's Language  to define creative writing. Marksberry notes:    Witty and LaBrant…[say creative writing] is a composition of any type of writing at any time primarily in the service of such needs as  the need for keeping records of significant experience,   the need for sharing experience with an interested group, and   the need for free individual expression which contributes to mental and physical health.
