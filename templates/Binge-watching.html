Binge-watching , also called  binge-viewing  or  marathon-viewing , is the practice of watching content (TV, streaming services, etc.) for a long time span, usually a single television show. In a survey conducted by Netflix in February 2014, 73% of people define binge-watching as "watching between 2-6 episodes of the same TV show in one sitting." Some researchers have argued that binge-watching should be defined based on the context and the actual content of TV show. Others suggested that what is normally called binge-watching in fact refers to more than one type of TV viewing behavior (and experience). They proposed that the notion of binge-watching should be expanded to include both the prolonged sit (watching 3 or more episodes in a row, in one sitting) and the accelerated consumption of an entire season (or seasons) of a show, one episode at a time, over several days. Binge-watching as an observed cultural phenomenon has become popular with the rise of video streaming services such as Netflix,   Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu through which the viewer can watch television shows and movies on-demand. For example, 61% of the Netflix survey participants said they binge-watch regularly. Recent research based on video-on-demand data from major US video streaming providers shows that over 64% of the customers binged-watched once during a year.
