Roller skating  is traveling on surfaces with roller skates. It is a recreational activity, a sport, and a form of transportation. Roller rinks and skate parks are built for roller skating, though it also takes place on streets, sidewalks, and bike paths.  Roller skating originated in the performing arts. In the United States, roller skating as a hobby began to gain popularity in the 1930s. In the 1970s it was associated with disco music and roller discos. During the 1990s, inline outdoor roller skating became popular.
