Stone skipping  and  stone skimming  are considered related but distinct activities: both refer to the art of throwing a flat stone across the water in such a way (usually sidearm) that it bounces off the surface. The objective of "skipping" is to see how many times a stone can bounce before it sinks into the water; the objective of "skimming" is to see how far a bouncing stone can travel across the water before it sinks into the water. In Japan, the practice is referred to as  Mizu Kiri , which loosely translates to "water cutting." In  Mizu Kiri  contests, both skimming and skipping principles, as well as a throw's overall aesthetic quality, are taken into account to determine the winners.
