Book collecting  is the collecting of books, including seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining whatever books are of interest to a given collector. The love of books is  bibliophilia , and someone who loves to read, admire, and a person who collects books is often called a  bibliophile  but can also be known as an  bibliolater , meaning being overly devoted to books, or a  bookman  which is another term for a person who has a love of books.  Book collecting can be easy and inexpensive: there are millions of new and used books, and thousands of bookstores, including online booksellers such as Abebooks, Alibris, Amazon, and Biblio.com. Books can also be collected in audio format through websites such as Audible, Google Audiobooks, Librivox, Kobo Audiobooks, and Downpour. Users can have a large library of books they can access at any time using a phone, tablet, or computer. Just like hard copy books, audio books can be accumulated over many years. Wealthy book collectors pursue great rarities such as the Gutenberg Bible, and Shakespeare's First Folio, books which are both famous and extremely valuable. Collectors of lesser means may collect works by a favorite author, first editions of modern authors, or books on a given subject. Book prices generally depend on the demand for a given edition, the number of copies available, and a book's  condition. For example, a first edition “And To Think That I Saw It On  Mulberry Street” can reach the price of $12,000 dollars in the best condition. Some collectors join associations such as The Fine Press Book Association, which is aimed at collectors of modern fine printing. The Private Libraries Association also covers modern fine printing, but is much more general in its outlook.
