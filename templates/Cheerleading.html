Cheerleading  is an activity in which the participants (called "cheerleaders") cheer for their team as a form of encouragement. It can range from chanting slogans to intense physical activity. It can be performed to motivate sports teams, to entertain the audience, or for competition. Cheerleading routines typically range anywhere from one to three minutes, and contain components of tumbling, dance, jumps, cheers, and stunting.   Cheerleading originated in the United States, and remains predominantly in America, with an estimated 3.85 million participants as of 2017.  The global presentation of cheerleading was led by the 1997 broadcast of  ESPN's International cheerleading competition, and the worldwide release of the 2000 film  Bring It On . The International Cheer Union (ICU) now claims 116 member nations with an estimated 7.5 million participants worldwide. The sport has gained a lot of traction in Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom with popularity continuing to grow as sport leaders pursue Olympic status.
