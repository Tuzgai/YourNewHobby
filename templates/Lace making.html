Lace  is a delicate fabric made of yarn or thread in an open weblike pattern, made by machine or by hand.  Originally linen, silk, gold, or silver threads were used. Now lace is often made with cotton thread, although linen and silk threads are still available. Manufactured lace may be made of synthetic fiber. A few modern artists make lace with a fine copper or silver wire instead of thread.
