Button collecting  may refer to the collecting of various types of buttons. This article refers to the collecting of clothing buttons.   Button collecting varies widely. In its most informal manifestation, a button collection may simply be the household button container, where buttons are stored for future use on clothing or for crafts. At the other end of the spectrum is the competitive collector, mainly found in the United States. The National Button Society  serves as a forum for collectors to build information about the history of buttons and for annual collector competitions. Regional, State and local button clubs meet regularly as well.  In between these two extremes exist casual button collectors, who accumulate buttons for sheer enjoyment and relaxation, as well as for their functional value.
