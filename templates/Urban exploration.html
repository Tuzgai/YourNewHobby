Urban exploration  (often shortened as  UE ,  urbex  and sometimes known as  roof-and-tunnel hacking ) is the exploration of manmade structures, usually abandoned ruins or hidden components of the manmade environment. Photography and historical interest/documentation are heavily featured in the hobby and it sometimes involves trespassing onto private property. Urban exploration is also called  draining  (a specific form of urban exploration where storm drains or sewers are explored),  urban spelunking ,  urban rock climbing ,  urban caving ,  building hacking , or  mousing.   The activity presents various risks, including both physical danger and, if done illegally and/or without permission, the possibility of arrest and punishment. Some activities associated with urban exploration violate local or regional laws and certain broadly interpreted anti-terrorism laws, or can be considered trespassing or invasion of privacy.
