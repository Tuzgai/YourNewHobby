Dowsing  is a type of divination employed in attempts to locate ground water, buried metals or ores, gemstones, oil, gravesites, malign 'earth vibrations' and many other objects and materials without the use of a scientific apparatus. Dowsing is also known as  divining  (especially in reference to interpretation of results),  doodlebugging  (particularly in the United States, in searching for petroleum) or (when searching specifically for water)  water finding ,  water witching  (in the United States) or  water dowsing .  A Y-shaped twig or rod, or two L-shaped ones—individually called a  dowsing rod ,  divining rod  (Latin: virgula divina or baculus divinatorius), "vining rod", or  witching rod —are sometimes used during dowsing, although some dowsers use other equipment or no equipment at all.  Dowsing is a pseudoscience, and there is no scientific evidence that it is any more effective than random chance. Dowsers often achieve good results because random chance has a high probability of finding water in favourable terrain. The motion of dowsing rods is now generally attributed to the ideomotor response. The ideomotor phenomenon is a psychological phenomenon wherein a subject makes motions unconsciously.  In less complex terms, dowsing rods only move due to accidental or involuntary movements of the user.  Despite there being no scientific verification, on at least one occasion, dowsing has been used in the mining industry to find a sizable body of gold, from which a substantial mine operation was established. Dowsing remains popular among believers in Forteana or radiesthesia.
