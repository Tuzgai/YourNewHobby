Table football , also known as  table soccer , and known as  foosball    in North America, is a table-top game that is loosely based on  association football / soccer. The aim of the game is to move the ball into the opponent's goal by manipulating rods which have figures attached. Although rules often vary by country and region when the game is played casually, at the competitive level table soccer is played according to a unified code.
