Needlepoint  is a type of  canvas work,  a form of counted thread embroidery in which yarn is stitched through a stiff open weave canvas. Traditionally  needlepoint designs completely cover the canvas. Although needlepoint may be worked in a variety of stitches, many needlepoint designs use only a simple tent stitch and rely upon color changes in the yarn to construct the pattern. Needlepoint is the oldest form of canvas work. The degree of detail in needlepoint depends on the thread count of the underlying mesh fabric.  Due to the inherent lack of suppleness of needlepoint, common uses include eyeglass cases, holiday ornaments, pillows, purses, upholstery, and wall hangings.
