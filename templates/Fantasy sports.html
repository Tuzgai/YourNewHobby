A  fantasy sport  (also known less commonly as  rotisserie  or  roto ) is a type of game, often played using the Internet, where participants assemble imaginary or virtual teams composed of proxies of real players of a professional sport.  These teams compete based on the statistical performance of those players in actual games.  This performance is converted into points that are compiled and totaled according to a roster selected by each fantasy team's manager.  These point systems can be simple enough to be manually calculated by a "league commissioner" who coordinates and manages the overall league, or points can be compiled and calculated using computers tracking actual results of the professional sport.  In fantasy sports, team owners draft, trade and cut (drop) players, analogously to real sports.
