Plastic arts   are art forms which involve physical manipulation of a plastic medium by molding or modeling such as sculpture or ceramics.  Less often the term may be used broadly for all the visual arts (such as painting, sculpture, film and photography), as opposed to literature and music.  Materials for use in the plastic arts, in the narrower definition, include those that can be carved or shaped, such as stone or wood, concrete, glass, or metal.  The term "plastic" has been used to mean certain synthetic organic resins ever since they were invented, but the term "plastic arts" long preceded them.  The term should not be confused, either, with Piet Mondrian's concept of "Neoplasticism".
