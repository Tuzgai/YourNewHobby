Mineral collecting  is the hobby of systematically collecting, identifying and displaying mineral specimens. Mineral collecting can also be a part of the profession of mineralogy and allied geologic specialties.  Individual collectors often specialize, for example collecting examples of the various colors and forms taken by the mineral calcite, calcite from widely scattered locations in a region or the world, or minerals found in pegmatites.
