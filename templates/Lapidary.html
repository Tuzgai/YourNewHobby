Lapidary  (from the Latin  lapidarius ) is the practice of shaping stone, minerals, or gemstones into decorative items such as cabochons, engraved gems (including cameos), and faceted designs. A person who practices lapidary is known as a  lapidarist . A lapidarist uses the lapidary techniques of cutting, grinding, and polishing. Hardstone carving requires specialized carving techniques. In modern contexts, a  gemcutter  is a person who specializes in cutting diamonds, but in older contexts refers to artists who produced hardstone carvings; engraved gems such as jade carvings, a branch of miniature sculpture or ornament in gemstone.  By extension, the term  lapidary  has sometimes been applied to collectors of and dealers in gems, or to anyone who is knowledgeable in precious stones.
