Entertainment , an activity that holds the attention of the viewer and is pleasing to said viewer. The activity can range from storytelling, music, drama, dance, and various types of performances. Since everyone has different preferences/interests what people would consider entertainment also differs. Resulting, in different forms of entertainment, such as previously listed.   Amusement and fun have been associated with what classifies an activity as entertainment. Even so, entertainment can also have a more serious tone, for example ceremonies, celebrations, and religious practices are all activities that are for entertaining purposes but also follow strict rules and traditions that have been passed down generation to generation. So just because something appears as though it is solely entertainment may also have a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth depending on the practice and/or culture for participants.   Forms of entertainment go back as far back as human history. Entertainment has always contributed a big part to culture, development of new technology, and fashion. For example, movies and video games are very new forms of entertainment. Meaning that either it be public, private, involving formal, scripted performances, or unscripted performances, the advances of entertainment will always maintain the core factors of storytelling, drama, music, and performance.   The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.
