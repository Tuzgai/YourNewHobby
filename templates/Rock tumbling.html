Tumble finishing , also known as  tumbling  or  rumbling , is a technique for smoothing and polishing a rough surface on relatively small parts.  In the field of metalworking, a similar process called  barreling , or  barrel finishing , works upon the same principles.  This process is very similar to the natural processes that produce "sea glass" or "beach glass".
