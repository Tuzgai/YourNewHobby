Hobby tunneling  (or  tunnelling ) is tunnel construction as a diversion. Usually, hobby tunnelers dig their tunnels by hand, using little equipment, and some can spend years or even decades to achieve any degree of completion. In some cases tunnels have been dug  secretly, and only discovered by chance.
