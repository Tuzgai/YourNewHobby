Inline skating  is a multi-disciplinary sport and can refer to a number of activities practiced using inline skates. Inline skates typically have two to five polyurethane wheels, arranged in a single line by a metal or plastic frame on the underside of a boot. The in-line design allows for greater speed and maneuverability than traditional (or "quad") roller skates. Following this basic design principle, inline skates can be modified to varying degrees to accommodate niche disciplines.  Inline skating is commonly referred to by the proprietary eponym "rollerblading", or just "blading", due to the popular brand of inline skates, Rollerblade.
