Record collecting  is the hobby of collecting sound recordings, usually of music, but sometimes "spoken word" (poetry reading ,comedy, historical speeches, etc.), in some cases (mostly on a smaller scale), other recorded sounds (e.g. ambient, airport, sounds of nature; bird calls, river, country, rural, forest, and other soundscapes etc.). Although the typical focus is on vinyl records, all formats of recorded music can be collected.
