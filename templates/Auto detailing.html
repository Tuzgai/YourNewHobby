Auto detailing  is an activity of systematically performing operations and procedures that keep the vehicle in its best possible condition, especially cosmetic, as opposed to mechanical. This is achieved by removing both visible and invisible contaminants from the vehicle's interior, and polishing the exterior to its original blemish free finish. The most basic detail options include an exterior wash and wax, interior vacuuming, window cleaning and surface polishing.
