Thru-hiking , or  through-hiking , is to hike an established end-to-end hiking trail or long-distance trail with continuous footsteps in one direction.  In the United States, the term is most commonly associated with the Appalachian Trail (AT), the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), and the Continental Divide Trail (CDT), but may also refer to other end-to-end hikes. Other examples of thru-hikes include Te Araroa in New Zealand, the Camino de Santiago in Spain, the Via Francigena in France and Italy, the Lycian Way in Turkey, the Israel National Trail, and the Great Divide Trail (GDT) in Canada.  The Appalachian Trail Conservancy defines a through-hike as one completed within a twelve-month period; this definition is used by many groups within the United States. Section hiking , on the other hand, refers to hiking a trail one section at a time, without continuity and not necessarily in sequence with the other sections or within one hiking season.
