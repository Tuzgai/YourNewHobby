Acroyoga  (also written  Acro-Yoga  or  Acro Yoga ) is a physical practice which combines yoga and acrobatics. Acroyoga includes many types of (mostly recreational) partner and group acrobatics in which at least someone is lifted. As such it also draws on traditions of circus arts, cheer-leading, and dance acro.  Acroyoga is more vigorous than many traditional forms of yoga as exercise, and may lead to more injuries.
