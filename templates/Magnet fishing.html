Magnet fishing , also called  magnetic fishing , is searching in outdoor waters for ferromagnetic objects available to pull with a strong neodymium magnet. The hobby is a combination of environmentalism and treasure hunting. The magnets used are strong enough to remove large debris such as discarded bicycles, guns, safes, bombs, grenades, coins and car tire rims from bodies of water, but many who engage in the hobby are hoping to find rare and valuable items as well. It is thought magnet fishing was initially started by boaters using magnets to recover fallen keys from the water. The hobby has been adopted by celebrities such as English rugby player James Haskell.
