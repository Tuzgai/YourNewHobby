Shuffleboard , more precisely  deck shuffleboard , and also known  as  floor shuffleboard , is a game in which players use cues to push weighted discs, sending them gliding down a narrow court, with the purpose of having them come to rest within a marked scoring area. As a more generic term, it refers to the family of shuffleboard-variant games as a whole.
