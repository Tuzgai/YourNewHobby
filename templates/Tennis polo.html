Tennis polo  (or  toccer ) is a field sport where two teams of ten players (nine field players and one goalkeeper) use a tennis ball to score goals by throwing the ball into a goal defended by a keeper who holds a racquet. Tennis polo shares elements of sports such as field handball, hurling, football, and lacrosse. The game may also be played where all field players have racquets including the goalkeeper.  The sport is interchangeably referred to as "tennis polo" or "toccer". There are players in 18 countries including Canada, Mexico, United States, Italy, and France. Adapted to be a fast-paced sport with little stoppage of play, players advance the ball by throwing or kicking within the field of play.
