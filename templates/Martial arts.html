Martial arts  are codified systems and traditions of combat practiced for a number of reasons such as self-defense; military and law enforcement applications; competition;  physical, mental, and spiritual development; entertainment; and the preservation of a nation's intangible cultural heritage. Although the term  martial art  has become associated with the fighting arts of East Asia, it originally referred to the combat systems of Europe as early as the 1550s. The term is derived from Latin and means "arts of Mars", the Roman god of war. Some authors have argued that  fighting arts  or  fighting systems  would be more appropriate on the basis that many martial arts were never "martial" in the sense of being used or created by professional warriors.
