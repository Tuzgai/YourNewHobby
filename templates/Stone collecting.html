Amateur geology  or  rock collecting  (also referred to as  rockhounding  in the United States and Canada) is the non-professional study and hobby of collecting rocks and minerals or fossil specimens from the natural environment.  In Australia, New Zealand and Cornwall, the activities of amateur geologists are called fossicking.  The first amateur geologists were prospectors looking for valuable minerals and gemstones for commercial purposes.  Eventually, however, more people have been drawn to amateur geology for recreational purposes, mainly for the beauty that rocks and minerals provide.
