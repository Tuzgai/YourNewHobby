Fashion  is an aesthetic expression, at a particular period and place and in a specific context, of clothing, footwear, lifestyle, accessories, makeup, hairstyle, and body proportions. In its everyday use, the term implies a look defined by the fashion industry as that which is  the look of the moment . What is called fashion is thus that which is made available and popular by fashion system (industry and media).    Fashion is also a source of art, allowing people to display their own unique taste and styling.Different designers are influenced by outside stimuli and reflect this inspiration in their works. For example, Gucci's 'stained green' jeans may look like a grass stain, but to many others they display purity, freshness and summer. In reaction to increased mass-production of commodities clothing at lower prices and global reach, sustainability has become an urgent issue among politicians, brands, and consumers.
