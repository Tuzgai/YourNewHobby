Walking  (also known as  ambulation ) is one of the main gaits of terrestrial locomotion among legged animals. Walking is typically slower than running and other gaits.  Walking is defined by an 'inverted pendulum' gait in which the body vaults over the stiff limb or limbs with each step. This applies regardless of the usable number of limbsâ€”even arthropods, with six, eight, or more limbs, walk.
