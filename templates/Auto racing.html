Auto racing  (also known as  car racing ,  motor racing , or  automobile racing ) is a motorsport involving the racing of automobiles for competition.  Auto racing has existed since the invention of the automobile. Races of various sorts were organised, with the first recorded as early as 1867. Many of the earliest events were effectively reliability trials, aimed at proving these new machines were a practical mode of transport, but soon became an important way for competing makers to demonstrate their machines. By the 1930s, specialist racing cars had developed.  There are now numerous different categories, each with different rules and regulations.
