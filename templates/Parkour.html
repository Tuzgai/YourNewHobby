Parkour  ( French:  [paʁkuʁ] ) is a training discipline using movement that developed from military obstacle course training. Practitioners, called tracers or  traceurs , aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment, without assistive equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Parkour includes running, climbing, swinging, vaulting, jumping, plyometrics, rolling, quadrupedal movement (crawling) and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation (not to be confused with freerunning). Parkour's development from military training gives it some aspects of a non-combative martial art.  Parkour is an activity that can be practiced alone or with others and is usually carried out in urban spaces, though it can be done anywhere. Parkour involves seeing one's environment in a new way, and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around, across, through, over and under its features. Parkour as a type of movement was established by David Belle in France in 1988, however the practice of similar movements in various communities around the world leads to discussion of the relevance of such an attribution. The discipline was popularised in the late 1990s and 2000s through films, documentaries, video games and advertisements.
