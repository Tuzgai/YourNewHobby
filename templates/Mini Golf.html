Miniature golf , also known as  minigolf ,  mini-putt ,  midget golf ,  crazy golf , or  putt-putt , is an offshoot of the sport of golf focusing solely on the putting aspect of its parent game. The aim of the game is to score the lowest number of points. It is played on courses consisting of a series of holes (usually a multiple of 9) similar to its parent, but characterized by their short length (usually within 10 yards from tee to cup).  The game uses artificial putting surfaces (such as carpet, artificial turf, or concrete), a geometric layout often requiring non-traditional putting lines such as bank shots, and artificial obstacles such as tunnels, tubes, ramps, moving obstacles such as windmills, and walls of concrete, metal, or fiberglass. When miniature golf retains many of these characteristics but without the use of any props or obstacles, it is purely a mini version of its parent game.  Resort towns and cities such as Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; Branson, Missouri; Pigeon Forge, Tennessee; Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin; and Wildwood, New Jersey, are known for their numerous mini golf courses.
