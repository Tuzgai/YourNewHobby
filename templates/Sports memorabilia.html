Sports memorabilia  refers to collectables associated with sports. Types include equipment, trophies, sports cards, autographs, photographs, etc.  A multi-billion-dollar industry has grown up around the trading of sports memorabilia. Individual items can be valued in the millions of dollars. For example, a T206 Honus Wagner baseball card was sold for $2.8 million in 2007. As a result, fakes have become a serious problem.
