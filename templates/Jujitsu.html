Jujutsu  (Japanese:  柔術   jūjutsu   listen   ), also known as  jiu-jitsu  and  ju-jitsu , is a family of Japanese martial arts and a system of close combat (unarmed or with a minor weapon) that can be used in a defensive or offensive manner to kill or subdue one or more weaponless or armed and armored opponents. A subset of techniques from certain styles of jujutsu was used to develop many modern martial arts and combat sports, such as judo, sambo, ARB, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and mixed martial arts.
