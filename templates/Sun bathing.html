Sun tanning  or simply  tanning  is the process whereby skin color is darkened or tanned. It is most often a result of exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or from artificial sources, such as a tanning lamp found in indoor tanning beds. People who deliberately tan their skin by exposure to the sun engage in a passive recreational activity of  sun bathing . Some people use chemical products which can produce a tanning effect without exposure to ultraviolet radiation, known as sunless tanning.
