Palmistry , also known as  palm reading ,  chiromancy , or  chirology , is the practice of fortune-telling through the pseudoscience study of the palm. The practice is found all over the world, with numerous cultural variations. Those who practice chiromancy are generally called  palmists ,  hand readers ,  hand analysts , or  chirologists .  There are many—often conflicting—interpretations of various lines and palmar features across various teachings of palmistry. Palmistry is practiced by the Hindu, Brahmins, and is also indirectly referenced in the Book of Job. The contradictions between different interpretations, as well as the lack of evidence for palmistry's predictions, have caused palmistry to be viewed as a pseudoscience by academics.
