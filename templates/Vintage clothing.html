Vintage clothing  is a generic term for garments originating from a previous era. The phrase is also used in connection with a retail outlet, e.g. in  vintage clothing store.  Today vintage dressing encompasses choosing accessories, mixing vintage garments with new, as well as creating an ensemble of various styles and periods. Vintage clothes typically sell at low prices for high end named brands. It has been part of the world since World War I as an idea of reusing clothing because of the textile shortage.  Vintage clothing can be found in cities at local boutiques or local charities, or on the internet (e.g. eBay and Etsy). Vintage clothing is also known as  retro  clothing.
