Digital hoarding  (also known as  e-hoarding ,  datahoarding  or  cyberhoarding ) is excessive acquisition and reluctance to delete electronic material no longer valuable to the user. The behavior includes the mass storage of digital artifacts and the retention of unnecessary or irrelevant electronic data. The term is increasingly common in pop culture, used to describe the habitual characteristics of compulsive hoarding, but in cyberspace. As with physical space in which excess items are described as "clutter" or "junk", excess digital media is often referred to as "digital clutter".
