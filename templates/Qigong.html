Qigong  ( ),  qi gong ,  chi kung , or  chi gung  (simplified Chinese:  气功 ; traditional Chinese:  氣功 ; pinyin:  qìgōng ; Wade–Giles:  ch‘i kung ;  lit.  'life-energy cultivation') is a millennia-old system of coordinated body-posture and movement, breathing, and meditation used for the purposes of health, spirituality, and martial-arts training. With roots in Chinese medicine, philosophy, and martial arts,  qigong  is traditionally viewed by the Chinese and throughout Asia as a practice to cultivate and balance qi (pronounced approximately as "chi"), translated as "life energy". Qigong  practice typically involves moving meditation, coordinating slow-flowing movement, deep rhythmic breathing, and a calm meditative state of mind. People practice  qigong  throughout China and worldwide for recreation, exercise, relaxation, preventive medicine, self-healing, alternative medicine, meditation, self-cultivation, and training for martial arts. Clinical research on  qigong  for its potential benefit in treating disease has shown no evidence that  qigong  has any therapeutic effect.
