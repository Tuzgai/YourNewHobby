Construction  is a general term meaning the art and science to form objects, systems, or organizations, and comes from Latin  constructio  (from  com-  "together" and  struere  "to pile up") and Old French  construction . To construct is the verb: the act of building, and the noun is construction: how something is built, the nature of its structure.  In its most widely used context, construction covers the processes involved in delivering buildings, infrastructure and industrial facilities, and associated activities through to the end of their life. It typically starts with planning, financing, and design, and continues until the asset is built and ready for use; construction also covers repairs and maintenance work, any works to expand, extend and improve the asset, and its eventual demolition, dismantling or decommissioning.  As an industry, construction accounts for more than 10% of global GDP (6-9% in developed countries) and employs around 7% of the global workforce - over 273m people. The output of the global construction industry was worth an estimated $10.8 trillion in 2017.
