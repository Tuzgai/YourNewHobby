Tour skating  is recreational long distance ice skating on natural ice. It is particularly popular in the Netherlands and the Nordic countries. It is becoming more popular in areas of North America such as New England,Southcentral Alaska, and Nova Scotia. While Nordic skating usually involves tours over open ice on marshes, lakes, rivers, or sea, in the Netherlands skaters follow marked routes on frozen canals and connected lakes. Consequently, there are differences in equipment and skating styles between these two regions. Alaskans often include winter camping on longer journeys of a hundred miles or more.  Nordic skating is a popular activity in Sweden but is also becoming more popular in Finland and Norway, where it is called  långfärdsskridskoåkning   (in Swedish) ,  retkiluistelu   (in Finnish)  and  turskøyting   (in Norwegian) . In Canada and the United States this style is often called  Nordic skating . Other names used are  trip skating  and  wild skating .  Dutch skating is called  toerschaatsen  and is regarded by some as a sport in its own right.
