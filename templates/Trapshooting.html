Trap shooting  (or  trapshooting  in North America) is one of the three major disciplines of competitive clay pigeon shooting (shooting shotguns at clay targets). The other disciplines are skeet shooting and sporting clays. They are distinguished roughly as follows, with variations within each group:    In trap shooting, the targets are launched from a single "house" or machine, generally away from the shooter.   In skeet shooting, targets are launched from two houses in somewhat sideways paths that intersect in front of the shooter.   Sporting clays includes a more complex course, with many launch points.
