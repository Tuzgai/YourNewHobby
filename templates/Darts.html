Darts  or  dart-throwing  is a competitive sport in which two or more players bare-handedly throw small sharp-pointed missiles known as  darts  at a round target known as a  dartboard .  Darts players are sometimes termed "dartists". Points can be scored by hitting specific marked areas of the board, though unlike in sports such as archery, these areas are distributed all across the board and do not follow a principle of points increasing towards the centre of the board. Though a number of similar games using various boards and rules exist, the term "darts" usually now refers to a standardised game involving a specific board design and set of rules.   While being a professional shooting sport, darts is also a traditional pub game.  Darts is commonly played in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, and recreationally enjoyed across the world.
