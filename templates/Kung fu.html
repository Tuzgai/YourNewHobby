Chinese martial arts , often named under the umbrella terms  kung fu  ( ; Chinese:  功夫 ; pinyin:  gōngfu ; Cantonese Yale:  gūng fū ),  kuoshu  ( 國術 ;  guóshù ) or  wushu  ( 武術 ;  wǔshù ), are several hundred fighting styles that have developed over the centuries in China. These fighting styles are often classified according to common traits, identified as "families" of martial arts. Examples of such traits include  Shaolinquan   ( 少林拳 ) physical exercises involving Five Animals ( 五形 ) mimicry or training methods inspired by Old Chinese philosophies, religions and legends. Styles that focus on qi manipulation are called  internal  ( 内家拳 ;  nèijiāquán ), while others that concentrate on improving muscle and cardiovascular fitness are called  external  ( 外家拳 ;  wàijiāquán ). Geographical association, as in  northern  ( 北拳 ;  běiquán ) and  southern  ( 南拳 ;  nánquán ), is another popular classification method.
