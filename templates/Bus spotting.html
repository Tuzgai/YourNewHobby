Bus spotting  is a pastime in which one seeks to see all buses in a particular fleet or those produced by a particular manufacturer. A person who engages in these activities is known as a  bus spotter ,  bus fan ,  bus enthu  (term in Singapore) (Chinese: 巴士迷; popular name in Hong Kong),  bus nut  (term popular in the UK) or  bus enthusiast  (although this term can also cover preservationists). Within the bus industry bus spotters are known as moquettes, from the material used to make the seat coverings. There are many enthusiasts of the bus and coach industry across the globe. Like train and aircraft spotters, bus spotters spend much time outdoors with notepads, cameras or camcorders, monitoring bus routes. Bus spotters are often uninterested in timetables and network quality, but they may be interested in new liveries, especially ad-hoc schemes to advertise particular products or events. Some may be so keen that they might track a vehicle through its life, knowing for example which fleet numbers it has carried with different owners and when mechanical parts or interior fittings were renewed. Bus spotting has never been as popular as train spotting in the UK, but enthusiasts can share the common term of "gricer".  Since bus spotting involves urban mass transit, it often goes hand in hand with metrophily. In New York, the two are often combined into "transit fan", a person who studies both bus and rail rapid transit, with the same diligence.  This practice is popular in York Region, Ontario, Canada.
