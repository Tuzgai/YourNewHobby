Shooting  is the act or process of discharging a projectile from a ranged weapon (such as a gun, bow, crossbow, slingshot, or blowpipe). Even the acts of launching flame, artillery, darts, harpoons, grenades, rockets, and guided missiles can be considered acts of shooting.  When using a firearm, the act of shooting is often called  firing  as it involves initiating a combustion (deflagration) of chemical propellants.  Shooting can take place in a shooting range or in the field, in shooting sports, hunting or in combat.  The person involved in the shooting activity is called a  shooter .  A skilled, accurate shooter is a  marksman  or  sharpshooter , and a person's level of shooting proficiency is referred to as their  marksmanship .
