Horseshoes  is a lawn game played between two people (or two teams of two people) using four horseshoes and two throwing targets (stakes) set in a lawn or sandbox area. The game is played by the players alternating turns tossing horseshoes at stakes in the ground,  which are traditionally placed 40 feet (12Â m) apart. Modern games use a more stylized U-shaped bar, about twice the size of an actual horseshoe.
