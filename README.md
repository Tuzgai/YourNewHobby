# Your New Hobby
## Random hobby recommendations

This app recommends a new hobby randomly, the initial list of hobbies is based on the [Wikipedia list of hobbies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hobbies)
and Wikipedia intro data. You can see how the initial data was generated in the Bootstrapping folder.

### Contributing
If you would like to add information to a hobby or add to the list of hobbies, please do!

You can find all of the hobby pages in the /templates/ directory. Simply edit the labelled section to add whatever information you like.
Ideas to get started: links to beginner resources, links to communities, a better description, a pitch for why the hobby is fun

If you'd like to add a new hobby to the list, just copy an existing template, update the filename, title field and information and you're good to go.
